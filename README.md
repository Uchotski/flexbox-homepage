# Challenge Project: Company Home Page with Flexbox

Use flexbox to design and build the layout for a company's home page. You can choose to build a new home page for an existing company, or imagine your own dream company!

## What to Include:

1. A title and logo, or splash image.
2. A mission statement or brief description of the company.
3. A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
4. A section describing some of the company's employees or teammates.

## How should you use Flexbox?

Use flexbox for easy horizontal and vertical positioning, flexible element sizing and styling for repeated elements!

The example project did the following:
 - Created a centred navbar.
 - Created a flexible display of products which changes from a grid-like list to a column list as the page shrinks.
 - Created a flexible display of company employees.

 You could also consider using flex-grow or flex-shrink.

 ## Other Site Considerations:

 - Simple colour scheme using CSS.
 - Fonts from GoogleFonts API.
 - Custom images.
